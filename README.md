## RNA-Seq analysis

RNA-Seq analysis was performed using the [sea-snap pipeline](https://github.com/bihealth/seasnap-pipeline). 
The YAML configuration files for the pipeline can be found in the yaml directory. 

Additional figures were generated using the pipeline output and the package
[Rseasnap](https://github.com/bihealth/Rseasnap) which allows to read
sea-snap objects directly into R. The R scripts can be found in the R directory.
